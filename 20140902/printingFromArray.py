"""
T. Swift's "Shake it Off" is the current number one song on iTunes
The first part of the chorus is as follows: 
	Players gonna play, play, play, play, play,
	Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
	I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
	Shake it off, shake it Off

Part 1, concatenate string variables from the array list of words in the chorus from above
(for example, chorusWords[0] will equal "gonna")

Part 2, write print statements to print the lines of the song

Part 3, clean up any code for better printing
